# Stress-Detection-using-Machine-Learning
Text  classification is a prominent application of machine learning that involves  categorizing text data into predefined classes. In the context of stress  detection, text classification techniques can be leveraged to determine  whether a given text message reflects a stressed or non-stressed state.

1. Naive Bayes: Naive Bayes is a probabilistic machine learning algorithm based 
on Bayes' theorem. It's commonly used for text classification tasks. In your 
project, you're utilizing the Bernoulli Naive Bayes variant to model the 
likelihood of words occurring in stressful and non-stressful messages.
